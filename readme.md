Here is a diary of sorts explaining the failures and successes involved in making this project.

Friday 3rd February 2022:

I added 95% of the main HTML into the file. The remaining 5% was unfinished due to it being the end of my shift. FontAwesome and Google Fonts were used for the icons and, well, fonts.

Friday 10th February 2022:

Worked on the Hungry Clients CSS first. I was not provided with a colour or image for the "Hungry Clients" section, so I used a Color Picker named RedKetchup to find the HTML Code: https://redketchup.io/color-picker
The speech marks (quotations) and arrows did not match the image's color at all (light yellow and white do NOT match well together), to the point where I had to rewrite some of the HTML a week later because I didn't even catch it. I have changed the color to a slightly darker grey to improve upon the design.
Couldn't figure out how the green line was added, but thankfully Galen told me an hr was needed. It sort of works now: not exact, but time constraints prevent any further revisions.

Doing the footer now. Took close to 5 hours to finish it, and other than a few things I can't figure out it all looks pretty solid. Moving onto the Header starting tomorrow.
